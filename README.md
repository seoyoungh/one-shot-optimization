## Setup an environment
```
$ conda env create -f requirements.yaml 
```

## Usage
### i) train parking occupancy rate prediction model
    - Run run_*.sh to train the prediction model or just pass as we uploaded the pre-trained model.
### ii) optimize parking price with pre-trained prediction model
    - Run optimize_*.sh to optimize the price with the pre-trained prediction model.
